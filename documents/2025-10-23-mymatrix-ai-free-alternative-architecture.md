# MyMatrix.AI: Your Personal Second Brain

## 🧠 What is MyMatrix?

**MyMatrix** is a free, open-source personal knowledge management system that acts as your second brain. It helps you capture, organize, and retrieve ideas from anywhere—using your voice, photos, videos, or text—and makes your knowledge searchable, shareable, and secure.

Think of it as your personal AI assistant that:
- **Captures** everything: ideas, articles, videos, meetings, photos
- **Organizes** automatically: AI-powered tagging and connections
- **Retrieves** instantly: semantic search finds what you need
- **Shares** securely: share knowledge with granular access control
- **Costs nothing**: built on free and open-source tools

---

## 🎯 Why MyMatrix?

### The Problem with Current Tools

Most knowledge management systems force you to choose:

| Problem | Typical Solution | Trade-off |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Expensive** | Notion, Roam ($8-15/mo) | Subscription fatigue |
| **Limited Capture** | Desktop-only apps | Miss ideas on-the-go |
| **Privacy Concerns** | Cloud-based services | Your data on their servers |
| **Weak Security** | Password-protected links | No real access control |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Proprietary formats | Can't leave without losing data |

### The Real Problem: Organizing Fatigue

**The most painful problem isn't the tools—it's the mental burden of organization.**

Here's what happens to most people:

```
Day 1: See interesting YouTube video
      → Bookmark it (or copy link to notes)
      → "I'll organize this later"

Day 7: Read great article, discover GitHub repo
      → Save links somewhere
      → "I'll tag these properly later"

Day 30: Have brilliant idea during commute
       → Voice memo on phone
       → "I'll transcribe this later"

Day 90: Want to share insights with colleague
       → Can't find that video
       → Can't remember which article had that quote
       → Voice memo lost in 100+ recordings
       → Give up: "I'll look for it later"

Result: 1000+ bookmarks, 500+ notes, 200+ voice memos
        All unorganized, unfindable, unshared
        Knowledge captured but effectively lost
```

**Why traditional tools fail:**

1. **Manual organization is exhausting** - After absorbing tons of information, who has energy to tag, categorize, and structure everything?

2. **Search fails with minimal context** - You saved a link with just "interesting video" - now what? Traditional search can't find it.

3. **Ideas evolve, but re-organizing is work** - That idea from 3 months ago is now refined, but updating all connections and tags? Too much effort.

4. **Sharing requires polish** - Can't share raw notes with colleagues. Need to reorganize, add context, make it presentable. Result: You don't share.

5. **The death spiral** - More you capture → more to organize → less energy to organize → more lost → less motivation to capture

**This is the core problem MyMatrix solves.**

### The MyMatrix Solution

**MyMatrix eliminates organizing fatigue by making AI do the heavy lifting.**

Here's how the same scenario works with MyMatrix:

```
Day 1: See interesting YouTube video
      → /youtube-note <link>
      → AI extracts transcript, summarizes, auto-tags
      → Stored in searchable vault
      ✅ Done in 5 seconds

Day 7: Read great article, discover GitHub repo
      → /capture <link> "useful for authentication project"
      → AI analyzes content, tags, suggests related notes
      ✅ Done in 5 seconds

Day 30: Have brilliant idea during commute
       → Voice record on MyMatrix mobile app
       → Auto-transcribed, AI-tagged, synced to vault
       ✅ Done in 5 seconds

Day 90: Want to share insights with colleague
       → Search "authentication security"
       → Semantic search finds ALL related content
       → Video, article, repo, voice note—all connected
       → Click /share → choose access level (private/team/public) → get link
       ✅ Found and shared in 30 seconds

Result: 1000+ notes, fully organized, instantly findable
        Zero manual organization required
        Always ready to share
        Knowledge captured AND accessible
```

**Core Principles:**

✅ **Zero-Effort Capture**: Drop a link, speak a thought, snap a photo—that's it
✅ **AI Does the Work**: Automatic tagging, summarization, connection-building
✅ **Smart Search**: Find things even with minimal context ("that authentication video")
✅ **Always Share-Ready**: Notes are always organized enough to share
✅ **Auto-Evolution**: AI updates connections as your knowledge grows—no manual re-organization

**Additional Benefits:**

✅ **Free Forever**: Built on open-source tools
✅ **Capture Anywhere**: Mobile app for voice, photo, video, audio
✅ **Privacy First**: Your data stays on your devices
✅ **Enterprise Security**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
✅ **Future-Proof**: Open standards, portable data
✅ **Remote Access**: SSH tunneling to access from anywhere

---

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

> **Philosophy**: Use what we have NOW, make it accessible EVERYWHERE, then gradually replace with free alternatives.

---

### Phase 1: Desktop Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: Fully operational (current state)

**What's Working:**
- [x] Claude Code/Desktop integration
- [x] Obsidian vault as knowledge base
- [x] AI-powered capture (/capture, /idea, /youtube-note, /study-guide)
- [x] Repository analysis (/gitingest)
- [x] Semantic search (Smart Connections)
- [x] GitHub Pages for sharing (basic password protection)

**Current Capability**: Desktop-only, powerful capture & organization

---

### Phase 2: Remote Access via P2P VPN 🚧 IN PROGRESS
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Goal**: Use Claude Code from anywhere via mobile browser

**Why This First?**
You already have a powerful desktop setup. Before building new tools, make what you have accessible on-the-go. Peer-to-peer VPN lets you access your desktop's Claude Code from your phone's browser—no server hosting needed.

**Technical Approach:**

**Option A: Tailscale (Recommended - Easiest)**
```bash
# On desktop (your "server")
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
tailscale up

# On mobile browser
# Visit: http://100.x.x.x:PORT (your Tailscale IP)
# Access Claude Code web UI
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free for personal use (20 devices)
- ✅ Zero-config P2P VPN (NAT traversal automatic)
- ✅ Works on cellular data
- ✅ Encrypted by default
- ✅ 5-minute setup

**Cons:**
- Relies on Tailscale service (though P2P data transfer)

**Option B: WireGuard + DDNS (Full Control)**
```bash
# On desktop
# Set up WireGuard server
# Configure DDNS (DuckDNS, No-IP)
# Mobile connects via WireGuard app
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fully self-hosted
- ✅ No third-party service

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Requires dynamic DNS
- May not work on some networks (CGNAT)

**Features to Implement:**
- [ ] P2P VPN setup guide (Tailscale + WireGuard options)
- [ ] Claude Code web UI optimization for mobile browsers
- [ ] Quick capture form (mobile-optimized)
- [ ] Voice input via browser Web Speech API
- [ ] Connection status monitoring
- [ ] Auto-reconnect on network change
- [ ] Bookmark/home screen shortcut guide

**Deliverable**: Access your desktop Claude Code + Obsidian vault from phone browser anywhere

**User Experience:**
```
Morning commute → Open Safari/Chrome on phone
→ Visit your Tailscale URL
→ Voice capture: "Capture: idea for meal planning app"
→ AI processes on your desktop
→ Note appears in vault
→ Total time: 10 seconds
```

---

### Phase 3: Native Mobile App (Web Replacement) 📱 PLANNED
**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks after Phase 2
**Goal**: Replace mobile browser with dedicated app for better UX

**Why After P2P VPN?**
Phase 2 proves the concept with minimal effort. Once validated, build a native app for:
- Better voice capture UX
- Background operation
- Offline-first capture (sync later)
- Native photo/video capture
- System integration (share sheet, widgets)

**Mobile App Features:**

**Capture Modes:**
- [ ] 🎤 Voice notes (instant transcription via Whisper)
- [ ] 📸 Photo capture (OCR + AI tagging)
- [ ] 🎥 Video notes (scene extraction + transcript)
- [ ] 🎵 Audio recording (meetings, lectures, podcasts)
- [ ] 📝 Quick text capture
- [ ] 🔗 URL capture (article analysis)

**Smart Features:**
- [ ] Offline mode (capture without internet, sync later)
- [ ] Background recording (continues when screen off)
- [ ] Batch processing (bulk capture → AI processes overnight)
- [ ] Auto-sync with desktop vault
- [ ] Voice commands ("MyMatrix, capture this idea...")
- [ ] Smart suggestions (AI suggests tags while you capture)

**Technical Stack:**
- Framework: **Flutter** (single codebase → iOS + Android)
- Speech-to-text: **Whisper API** or local model
- OCR: **Tesseract** (local, free)
- Sync: **Git-based** or custom API to desktop
- Storage: **SQLite** (local-first)

**Deliverable**: Native iOS + Android app, better than mobile browser UX

**My Recommendation:**
Consider **Progressive Web App (PWA)** first before native app:
- Installable from browser (like native app)
- Push notifications
- Offline support
- Share sheet integration
- 90% of native features, 10% of development time
- No App Store approval delays

---

### Phase 4: Component Alternatives (Freedom Options) 🆓 PLANNED
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks after Phase 3
**Goal**: Provide free alternatives to replace paid/proprietary components

**Why Now?**
You have a working system (desktop + mobile). Now give users choice to replace expensive components with free alternatives based on their priorities.

**Replacement Strategy: Modular Options**

Users choose which components to replace based on their needs:

#### Option 1: Replace GitHub Pages → GitLab CE (Better Sharing)
**Priority**: High (security + RBAC)

**Why Replace:**
- GitHub Pages: Basic password protection only
- GitLab CE: Enterprise RBAC, user management, audit logs, SSO

**Implementation:**
- [ ] GitLab CE self-hosting guide (Docker Compose one-command)
- [ ] Jekyll/Hugo static site generator
- [ ] One-command sharing workflow: `/share note.md --access team`
- [ ] Role-based access control setup
- [ ] User/group management
- [ ] Audit logging (who accessed what, when)

**Deliverable**: Secure sharing with granular access control

---

#### Option 2: Replace Claude Code → Gemini + Ollama (Cost Reduction)
**Priority**: Medium (save $20/mo, but quality trade-off)

**Why Replace:**
- Claude Code: $20/mo, excellent quality
- Gemini Free Tier: 1,000 req/day, 90% quality
- Ollama (local): Unlimited, 80% quality, offline

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Gemini API integration (free tier)
- [ ] Ollama local setup guide
- [ ] Hybrid routing: Gemini (primary) → Ollama (fallback/offline)
- [ ] Quality comparison dashboard
- [ ] Easy toggle: Claude ↔ Gemini ↔ Ollama

**My Recommendation:**
Keep Claude as default, offer Gemini+Ollama as "budget mode":
```
mymatrix config --ai-provider gemini  # Save $20/mo
mymatrix config --ai-provider claude  # Best quality
mymatrix config --ai-provider ollama  # Offline/privacy
```

**Deliverable**: Users choose: Pay for quality (Claude) vs. Free (Gemini/Ollama)

---

#### Option 3: Replace Smart Connections → ChromaDB (Free Semantic Search)
**Priority**: Low (Smart Connections is already affordable)

**Why Replace:**
- Smart Connections: $120/year (if premium)
- ChromaDB: Free, open-source, fast

**Implementation:**
- [ ] ChromaDB local setup
- [ ] Embedding model selection (sentence-transformers)
- [ ] Auto-index vault on save
- [ ] Semantic search UI
- [ ] Related notes suggestions

**Deliverable**: Free semantic search, fully local

---

#### Option 4: Advanced Voice Features (Whisper Local)
**Priority**: Medium (improve Phase 3 mobile app)

**Why Add:**
- Phase 3 uses browser voice (limited)
- Whisper (local): Better accuracy, works offline, multilingual

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Whisper model integration (local or API)
- [ ] Conversation transcription (long recordings)
- [ ] Meeting notes with action items extraction
- [ ] Speaker diarization (basic: you vs. others)
- [ ] Podcast/lecture summarization

**Deliverable**: Professional-grade voice transcription

---

**Phase 4 Summary:**
Modular replacements—users pick based on priorities:
- **Save money**: Replace Claude with Gemini/Ollama

- [ ] Task assignments ("@Bob, review this")
- [ ] Team chat (in-app messaging)
- [ ] Approval workflows (draft → review → published)

**Team Analytics:**
- [ ] Most active contributors
- [ ] Knowledge coverage map
- [ ] Search analytics (what people look for)
- [ ] Sharing metrics (most viewed notes)
- [ ] Team growth over time

**Deliverable**: MyMatrix for teams (2-50 users)

**My Recommendations:**

**A. Start with "Team View" (Simpler)**
Before full collaboration, add read-only team sharing:
- Personal vault stays private
- "Team" folder syncs to shared space
- Others can view/search, but not edit
- Easier to build, 80% of value

**B. Add Async Collaboration (Not Real-Time)**
Real-time sync is hard. Start with:
- Comments (not live editing)
- Suggested changes (PR-style)
- Scheduled merges (sync once per day)
- Reduces complexity, still useful

**C. Consider Team Size Tiers:**
- **Small Team (2-5 users)**: Simple shared folder
- **Medium Team (5-20 users)**: Role-based access
- **Large Team (20+ users)**: Full enterprise features

## 🎯 Recommended Priority Adjustments

Based on typical user needs, I suggest this parallel development approach:

**Quick Wins (Can Build in Parallel):**
1. **Browser extension** (Phase 7) - Build during Phase 2
   - High value, low effort
   - Increases capture frequency
   - Independent of other phases

2. **GitLab sharing** (Phase 4) - Build during Phase 3
   - Critical for professional users
   - Can start before mobile app
   - Solves security pain point early

**Strategic Sequencing:**
- ✅ **Your Plan is Solid**: P2P VPN first makes perfect sense
- 💡 **Recommendation**: Add browser extension in Phase 2 (parallel)
- 💡 **Recommendation**: Move GitLab to Phase 3 (before component alternatives)
- 💡 **Recommendation**: Add "Team View" (read-only) before full collaboration

**Revised Priority:**
1. P2P VPN (your Phase 2) ← Start here
2. Browser Extension (parallel with #1) ← Quick win
3. GitLab Sharing (your Phase 4) ← Move up
4. Native Mobile App (your Phase 3) ← After proving VPN works
5. Component Alternatives (your Phase 4) ← Keep as-is
6. SSO Security (your Phase 5) ← Keep as-is
7. Team Vault (your Phase 6) ← Keep as-is

This gives you:
- Remote access NOW (Phase 2)
- Better capture NOW (browser extension)
- Secure sharing SOONER (GitLab before mobile)
- Mobile app AFTER validating remote workflow

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Local-First Software

**Your data should live on your devices, not in someone else's cloud.**

- **Offline-first**: Works without internet
- **Sync when ready**: No forced cloud dependency
- **Full control**: Delete anytime, no vendor lock-in
- **Fast**: No network latency
- **Private**: No one can see your data

### Privacy by Design

**Privacy isn't a feature, it's the foundation.**

- **Local AI**: Processing on your hardware
- **Encrypted transit**: SSH tunnels only
- **No tracking**: Zero telemetry or analytics
- **Self-hosted**: You control the servers
- **Audit logs**: See who accessed what

### Open-Source Ethos

**Code you can trust, tools you can modify.**

- **Transparent**: Audit the entire codebase
- **Forkable**: Don't like something? Change it
- **Community-driven**: Contributions welcome
- **No vendor lock-in**: Standards-based
- **Forever free**: No rug pulls, no price increases

## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is MyMatrix really free?**
A: Yes. All software is open-source. You only pay for:
- Claude Pro subscription ($20/mo) - which you might already have
- Optional: Hardware for self-hosting ($75-500 one-time)
- Optional: Electricity (~$2-3/mo)

**Q: Do I need to be technical?**
A: Basic technical skills help (command line, installing software), but we're building detailed guides. If you can use Obsidian, you can use MyMatrix.

**Q: When will mobile app be ready?**
A: Beta launch planned for 8-12 weeks from now. Sign up for early access.

**Q: Can I use it without Claude?**
A: Eventually yes (Phase 5), using free alternatives (Gemini + Ollama). But Claude provides the best quality today.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes. Everything runs locally or on your servers. Claude API only sees content you explicitly send for analysis. No telemetry, no tracking.

**Q: Can teams use it?**
A: Phase 6 (weeks 21-24) adds team collaboration. For now, it's single-user focused.

**Q: How does it compare to Notion?**
A: Notion is easier to start but costs $8-15/mo, stores data in their cloud, and locks you in. MyMatrix is free, local-first, and yours forever—but requires initial setup.

**Q: Can I migrate from [other tool]?**
A: Yes. Markdown import from most tools. Guides for Notion, Roam, Evernote, etc.

**Q: I have thousands of unorganized bookmarks and notes. Will MyMatrix help?**
A: Yes! This is exactly what MyMatrix solves. Just import your messy notes, then:
1. Run bulk AI tagging on everything (one command)
2. Let semantic search index it all (automatic)
3. Search naturally: "that video about authentication" works even with zero tags
4. AI finds connections between old and new notes automatically
5. No manual re-organization needed—ever

**Q: What if I just paste links with minimal context? Will it still work?**
A: Absolutely! That's the point. Examples:
- You paste: "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123 useful"
- AI extracts: Full transcript, summary, tags: [video, tutorial, react, hooks, performance]
- Later you search: "react hooks performance" → Finds it instantly

Even with minimal input, AI creates rich, searchable notes.

**Q: My ideas evolve over time. Do I need to manually update old notes?**
A: No! AI automatically:
- Detects related notes as your knowledge grows
- Suggests connections between old and new ideas
- Updates semantic index so search improves naturally
- Shows you "related notes" without manual linking

Your knowledge graph grows organically—zero maintenance.

**Q: I want to share notes but they're too messy. What should I do?**
A: MyMatrix notes are always "share-ready" because:
- AI organizes them automatically (tags, structure, summary)
- You can preview before sharing
- Choose access level: private (just you), team (colleagues), or public (anyone with link)
- Recipients see clean, organized content—not your raw dumps

Sharing goes from "I'll clean this up later" (never happens) to "here's the link" (2 clicks with `/share`).
