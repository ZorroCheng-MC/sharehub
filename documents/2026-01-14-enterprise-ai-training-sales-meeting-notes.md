**Context**: Sales discovery call for AI training and Google Workspace migration
**Client Profile**: Hong Kong manufacturing company with ~20-30 staff (HK operations), plus mainland China production facility

---

## 🎯 Client Requirements Summary

### Current Situation
- **Staff demographics**: 70-80 employees total, many with limited computer literacy
- **Current email**: On-premises Microsoft Exchange
- **ERP system**: SAP S/4 HANA (on-premises)
- **Pain point**: Heavy paperwork, especially in accounting department
- **Location**: Sha Tin, Hong Kong (operations) + Mainland China (production)

### Desired Outcomes
1. **AI adoption** for productivity tools (reports, PowerPoint creation)
2. **Reduce paperwork** in accounting department (bookkeeping, invoices, customer orders)
3. **Email migration** to Google Workspace (Gmail)
4. **AI-powered features**:
   - Google Meet summaries (Cantonese support noted as important)
   - Email search using AI/RAG chatbot
   - NotebookLM for document analysis

## 📦 Proposed Solution Package

### Training Bundle Options
| Package | Duration | Includes |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Basic | 4 hours | NotebookLM + Gmail basics |
| Extended | 8 hours | Comprehensive AI training |

**License structure**: 15 users per bundle (can add more licenses)
**Customization**: Training content can be tailored to client needs

### Two-Phase Quotation
1. **Quote 1**: AI Training Bundle (NotebookLM + Gemini Enterprise upgrade)
2. **Quote 2**: Google Workspace / Gmail migration services

---

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Email Migration
- **Current**: On-premises Exchange with 10 years of email data
- **Monthly volume**: ~30GB company-wide
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Keep legacy Exchange as archive (don't migrate old emails)
  - Parallel period of 1-2 months (receive on both systems)
  - New emails only on Gmail going forward

### SAP Integration
- **Challenge**: SAP S/4 HANA is on-premises, not cloud-based
- **Google integration**: No native SAP connector currently available
- **Workaround**: Daily CSV export from SAP → Google Drive → AI analysis
- **Full integration**: Would require system analysis study (separate project)

### Mainland China Access
- **Requirement**: Dedicated line (專線) for compliant cross-border internet access
- **Scope**: Focus on Hong Kong operations first

## 💡 Key Insights

### Sales Opportunities
1. **Upsell path**: Basic bundle → Gemini Enterprise → Full Google Workspace
2. **Additional service**: Email migration from Exchange (separate team/quotation)
3. **Future opportunity**: SAP cloud migration for full AI integration

### Client Concerns
- Limited tech literacy among staff (needs user-friendly approach)
- Cantonese language support for AI features
- Legacy email retrieval speed (current Exchange is slow)
- Cost and approval timeline

### Recommendations Given
- Don't migrate old emails to Gmail (keep as archive)
- Start with 15-user pilot across departments
- Use CSV export as interim SAP data bridge
- Gmail training should precede advanced AI features
