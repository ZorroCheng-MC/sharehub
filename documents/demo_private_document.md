# Demo Private Document

This is a demonstration of the new tag-based password protection system.

## How It Works

This document is protected because it has `access: private` in its front matter. 

- **Password:** maco
- **Location:** documents/demo_private_document.md
- **Protection:** Tag-based (not folder-based)

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Flexible Organization** - Files can be organized by topic, not by access level
2. **Easy Management** - Just add or remove `access: private` tag
3. **Single Folder** - All documents now live in the `documents/` folder
4. **Works for Both HTML and Markdown** - Consistent protection across file types

## Testing the System

Try accessing this document through Jekyll to see the password protection in action!
