# A Code Editor That Actually Scales

[![Watch on YouTube](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kCWwrx51IS4/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCWwrx51IS4)

## 📖 Description

An in-depth look at Zed, a Rust-native code editor that's challenging Cursor's dominance by focusing on performance and collaboration. This video explores how Zed tackles two major pain points: lag on large projects and the lack of real-time multiplayer editing. Unlike AI-heavy editors, Zed makes AI optional while delivering blazing-fast performance on massive codebases (100K+ lines) without any lag.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this video, you will understand:
- How Zed's Rust-native architecture delivers superior performance compared to Electron-based editors
- The key differences between Zed's optional AI approach vs Cursor's AI-first philosophy
- How Zed's real-time collaboration features (channels, live cursors, audio chat) work
- When to choose Zed over Cursor based on your workflow needs
- Zed's integration with Claude via ACP (Agent Client Protocol) for better reasoning
- Navigation shortcuts and workflow optimization in Zed

## 📋 Curriculum/Contents

**Introduction: The Performance Question**
- Is editor slowness caused by the codebase or the editor itself?
- Zed's positioning as a performance-first alternative to Cursor

**Core Architecture & Performance**
- Rust-native implementation (no Electron, no browser overhead)
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Handling 100K+ line codebases without lag
- Demo: Smooth scrolling and updates on large JSON files

**Navigation & Core Features**
- Command P: Instant file search
- Command Shift O: Symbol search (functions, classes)
- Command Shift F: Repo-wide search with instant results
- Minimalistic UI design philosophy

**AI Integration (Optional)**
- Control Enter: Claude suggestions with focused context
- Command Shift A: Sidebar AI editor (Cursor-like experience)
- ACP (Agent Client Protocol) integration for better reasoning
- AI helps and then gets out of the way (no constant popups)

**Collaboration Features**
- Channels: Slack/Discord-like integration inside the editor
- Command Shift C: Create channels and invite teammates from GitHub
- Real-time cursors and avatars
- Live edits (Google Docs for code)
- Built-in audio chat for pair programming
- Designed for multiplayer from the ground up

**Zed vs Cursor: The Trade-offs**
- Performance: Native vs Electron, GPU acceleration vs browser-based
- AI Philosophy: Optional AI vs AI-first approach
- Collaboration: Built-in multiplayer vs solo-focused workflow
- Use cases: When to choose each editor

## 📝 Notes & Key Takeaways

### Main Insights

1. **Performance is Architecture**: Zed's Rust-native, GPU-accelerated design eliminates lag even on massive codebases where Cursor starts to struggle
2. **AI as a Tool, Not the Center**: Unlike Cursor's heavy AI-first approach, Zed makes AI optional—it helps when needed, then disappears
3. **Multiplayer by Design**: Zed's channels, real-time cursors, and built-in audio chat make it a collaboration-first editor, something Cursor lacks
4. **Speed Over Features**: Zed prioritizes instant feedback and low overhead over feature bloat
5. **Claude Integration via ACP**: More intelligent reasoning and cleaner code reviews without making the editor feel heavy

### Actionable Points

- Try Zed if you work on repos with 100K+ lines and experience lag in other editors
- Use Command P, Command Shift O, and Command Shift F for lightning-fast navigation
- Enable Claude integration (Control Enter) for contextual code suggestions
- Set up channels (Command Shift C) for team collaboration and pair programming
- Compare workflows: Solo AI-heavy (Cursor) vs balanced AI with multiplayer (Zed)
