# How to Transition from AI Automation to Agentic Workflows

[![Watch on YouTube](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5rNu19PfgFg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rNu19PfgFg)

## 📖 Description

This video demonstrates the simplest way to transition from older no-code automation platforms (n8n, Make, Zapier) to modern agentic workflows. Nick shows how to wrap AI agents inside existing no-code automations to combine the best of both worlds—visual workflows clients understand with powerful AI capabilities.

The approach allows you to reduce complex 15-20 node workflows down to just 4-5 nodes by abstracting heavy lifting to AI agents while maintaining the deployment advantages, visual clarity, and maintainability of no-code platforms.

## 📝 Notes & Key Takeaways

### Main Insights

1. **The Hybrid Approach**: Instead of choosing between no-code platforms OR agentic workflows, combine them—use no-code for trigger/action, AI agent for complex middle logic

2. **Three Core Benefits**:
   - **Deployment solved**: No-code platforms handle hosting, scaling, and infrastructure
   - **Visual clarity**: Clients understand boxes and arrows better than code
   - **Built-in maintainability**: Error handling, retries, and flow control come free

3. **Workflow Reduction**: Complex 15-20 node workflows can be reduced to 4-5 nodes by abstracting all heavy lifting to an AI agent via a simple HTTP request

4. **Real Business Impact**: Nick's example is a production system running his $2M/year dental marketing company, not a toy demo

5. **Cost Efficiency**: Modal credits are extremely cheap (~$5 lasts for thousands of requests) compared to Make/n8n subscription costs

### Actionable Points

✅ **Immediate Setup Steps**:
1. Get Modal account (modal.com) and create API token
2. Download the claw.md workspace template (linked in video)
3. Initialize AI agent with Modal credentials
4. Describe your workflow to the agent in natural language
5. Get back a ready-to-use curl command
6. Paste into n8n/Make HTTP request node

✅ **Workflow Structure**:
- **Start**: Keep your existing trigger (webhook, CRM event, email, etc.)
- **Middle**: Replace complex logic nodes with single HTTP request to AI agent
- **End**: Keep your existing action (send email, update CRM, etc.)

✅ **Security**: The template automatically includes header-based authentication to protect your endpoints

✅ **Testing**: Agent builds, tests locally, then deploys—you get a working URL immediately

✅ **Alternative Platforms**: Ask your AI agent for Modal alternatives if you prefer different serverless platforms
