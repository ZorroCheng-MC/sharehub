# Open Source Project Monetization Strategy - Phase-based Approach

## Business Registration (BR) Strategy

**Key Decision: Start WITHOUT company registration**
- Collect donations under personal name initially
- Register company later when project matures and income stabilizes
- All platforms allow personal accounts with KYC using personal credentials

**Hong Kong Tax Context:**
- No capital gains tax on crypto
- Small passive donations to open source = likely treated as gifts (not taxable)
- Keep records from day one
- Consider tax consultation if annual income exceeds ~HK$100,000

---

## Phase 1: Launch & Early Adoption (Months 0-6)

**Goal:** Establish presence, start collecting small donations

**Account Setup:**
- Create dedicated Gmail account for project
- **GitHub:** Open source repository (no KYC needed)
- **Crypto Wallet:** Exodus or MetaMask (non-custodial, no KYC)
  - Display wallet address on GitHub for crypto donations
- **Buy Me a Coffee:** 
  - Sign up with project Gmail
  - Connect PayPal (personal account)
  - Receive one-time donations
  
**Why this setup:**
- Minimal friction to start
- No upfront verification barriers
- Crypto wallet = zero fees, instant setup
- PayPal = trusted by general public

**Expected Income:** Small, sporadic donations

---

## Phase 2: Growing Community (Months 6-12)

**Goal:** Enable recurring support, expand payment options

**Add:**
- **Patreon:** For recurring monthly supporters
  - Same Gmail account
  - Connect PayPal for payouts
  - Offer tiered membership benefits
  
**Considerations:**
- Complete KYC on platforms when ready to withdraw
- Use personal ID/address documents
- Funds accumulate until verification complete

**Expected Income:** Regular small contributions, some recurring supporters

---

## Phase 3: Established Project (12+ months)

**Goal:** Professionalize operations, optimize for sustainability

**When to register company:**
- Monthly income becomes regular (e.g., HK$10,000+/month)
- Need to sign contracts or hire contributors
- Want liability protection
- Tax benefits outweigh setup costs (~HK$3,000-5,000 for BR)

**Account Migration:**
- Register HK company (BR)
- Open business bank account
- Upgrade platform accounts to business accounts
- Add Stripe for better fees (2.9% vs PayPal's 4.4%)
- Transfer ownership of GitHub organization to company

**Tax Compliance:**
- File annual tax returns
- Proper bookkeeping
- Consider hiring accountant
