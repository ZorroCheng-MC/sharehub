# Double-Cmd-C - Friction-Free Knowledge Pipeline

## 💡 Core Idea

**Double-Cmd-C: The simplest way to feed your AI-managed KnowledgeFactory.**

Just **double-tap Cmd+C** on any fragmented idea, YouTube link, web page, or GitHub repo → Your AI-managed KnowledgeFactory handles everything else.

**What you do:**
1. See something valuable (anywhere on macOS)
2. Select it → Double-tap Cmd+C
3. Keep working (zero interruption)

**What KnowledgeFactory does for you:**
1. 📥 **Captures** - Instantly saves to your vault
2. 🏷️ **Curates** - AI detects type, tags, formats
3. 🌱 **Nurtures** - Connects to related ideas
4. 🔨 **Develops** - Provides tools to refine
5. 🔄 **Evolves** - Semantic search finds connections
6. 🌐 **Shares** - One hotkey publishes to world

**The beauty: You only provide raw input. KnowledgeFactory transforms it into refined, shareable knowledge.**

## 🎯 Why This Matters: Simplicity Meets Power

### The Problem: Managing Knowledge is Hard

**Traditional approach requires you to:**
1. ❌ Decide where to save (which app? which folder?)
2. ❌ Create the file manually
3. ❌ Format the content (headings, structure)
4. ❌ Add tags and metadata
5. ❌ Link to related content
6. ❌ Remember to review and refine
7. ❌ Export and publish when ready to share

**Result**: Too much work → Most ideas lost forever

### The Solution: You Capture, KnowledgeFactory Does Everything Else

**With Double-Cmd-C, you only do ONE thing:**
- ✅ See something valuable → Double-Cmd-C

**KnowledgeFactory automatically handles:**
- ✅ Saving to the right place
- ✅ Creating properly formatted note
- ✅ Adding smart AI tags
- ✅ Linking to related ideas
- ✅ Making it searchable (semantic + keyword)
- ✅ Providing tools to refine when you want
- ✅ Publishing with one hotkey when ready

**Result**: Zero friction → 100% capture rate

### Emphasis on Simplicity

**What makes Double-Cmd-C powerful:**

### Before Double-Cmd-C vs. After Double-Cmd-C

**Before: Partial Automation (Stages 2-5 only)**
```
Manual entry → AI curation → Obsidian → Manual export → Share
    ↑                                         ↑
  FRICTION                                 FRICTION
  (5-30 sec)                              (2-5 min)
```

**After: Complete Automation (All 6 Stages)**
```
Double-Cmd-C → AI curation → Obsidian → Cmd+Shift+P → Share
      ↓                                       ↓
  NO FRICTION                             NO FRICTION
  (0.5 sec)                               (5 sec)
```

**The difference**: You only provide raw input. KnowledgeFactory handles everything else.

### The Integration Points

**Double-Cmd-C leverages existing KnowledgeFactory infrastructure:**

1. **Hammerspoon** (macOS automation)
   - Monitors keyboard events for double Cmd+C
   - Reads clipboard content
   - Triggers Claude Code command

2. **Claude Code** (AI processing)
   - Receives clipboard content via Hammerspoon
   - Runs `/capture` or `/youtube-note` or `/idea` based on content type
   - Uses existing MCP servers (YouTube, GitHub, Firecrawl, Obsidian)

3. **obsidian-vault-manager-plugin** (templates & automation)
   - Content type detection logic (already exists)
   - AI tagging with taxonomy (already exists)
   - Template routing (already exists)
   - `/publish` command (already exists)

4. **Sharehub** (publishing platform)
   - Two-repo architecture (vault → sharehub)
   - Image handling (copy + path conversion)
   - GitHub Pages deployment
   - Password protection support

**Double-Cmd-C adds:**
- ✅ Global keyboard shortcut (Double-Cmd-C for capture)
- ✅ Background processing (no terminal required)
- ✅ Visual notifications (capture success/failure)
- ✅ Publish hotkey (Cmd+Shift+P or similar)
- ✅ Error handling (offline mode, rate limiting)

### Real-World Example: From Fragmented Idea to Published Knowledge

**Scenario**: You see a valuable tweet thread about AI architecture

**Without Double-Cmd-C (9 steps, 5+ minutes):**
1. Copy tweet URL
2. Switch to terminal
3. Run `claude`
4. Run `/capture <paste-url>`
5. Wait for processing
6. Switch to Obsidian to verify
7. Manually export to blog/Medium
8. Format for publishing
9. Share URL

**With Double-Cmd-C (2 simple gestures, 68 seconds):**
1. Select tweet URL → **Double-Cmd-C** (0.5s)
   - *Notification: "✅ Captured! Article note created with tags: [AI, architecture, reference]"*
   - Continue browsing, no interruption
2. Note appears in vault (3s AI processing in background)
   - Fully formatted, tagged, organized
3. (Optional) Review and refine note in Obsidian
4. **Cmd+Shift+P** to publish (5s + 60s deploy)
   - *Notification: "🚀 Publishing AI architecture thread..."*
   - *Final: "✅ Published! https://yourname.github.io/sharehub/documents/ai-architecture-thread.html"*
   - URL copied to clipboard automatically

**Result**: From fragmented tweet → refined published knowledge in 68 seconds
**Your effort**: 2 simple hotkeys (Double-Cmd-C + Cmd+Shift+P)
**KnowledgeFactory's work**: Detection, extraction, formatting, tagging, linking, publishing

## 🏷️ Tags Analysis

**Content Analysis:**
- **Type**: `idea` (Captured thought/concept for a productivity tool)
- **Topics**: `productivity` (workflow optimization), `automation` (keyboard shortcuts, background processing), `knowledge-management` (Obsidian integration, capture workflow), `tools` (macOS utility)
- **Characteristics**: `actionable` (has concrete implementation steps), `technical` (requires Hammerspoon scripting, MCP integration, clipboard handling)
- **Priority**: `high` - This directly addresses the core friction point in knowledge capture workflows. Implementing this would significantly improve the KnowledgeFactory user experience and adoption.

**Why These Tags:**
- `productivity` + `automation` + `knowledge-management` + `tools` cover the four key aspects of this solution
- `actionable` because there are clear next steps for implementation
- `technical` because it requires scripting, API integration, and understanding of macOS automation
- `high` priority because reducing capture friction is a known high-leverage improvement

**Suggested Bases Filters:**
- Find similar ideas: `type = idea AND tags contains "productivity"`
- Find actionable items: `type = idea AND tags contains "actionable" AND status = inbox`
- Find by priority: `priority = high AND status = inbox`
