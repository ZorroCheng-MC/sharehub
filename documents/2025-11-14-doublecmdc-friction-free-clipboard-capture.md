## 🎯 Why This Matters: Simplicity Meets Power

### The Problem: Managing Knowledge is Hard

**Traditional approach requires you to:**
1. ❌ Decide where to save (which app? which folder?)
2. ❌ Create the file manually
3. ❌ Format the content (headings, structure)
4. ❌ Add tags and metadata
5. ❌ Link to related content
6. ❌ Remember to review and refine
7. ❌ Export and publish when ready to share

**Result**: Too much work → Most ideas lost forever

### Before Double-Cmd-C vs. After Double-Cmd-C

**Before: Partial Automation (Stages 2-5 only)**
```
Manual entry → AI curation → Obsidian → Manual export → Share
    ↑                                         ↑
  FRICTION                                 FRICTION
  (5-30 sec)                              (2-5 min)
```

**After: Complete Automation (All 6 Stages)**
```
Double-Cmd-C → AI curation → Obsidian → Cmd+Shift+P → Share
      ↓                                       ↓
  NO FRICTION                             NO FRICTION
  (0.5 sec)                               (5 sec)
```

**The difference**: You only provide raw input. KnowledgeFactory handles everything else.

### The Integration Points

**Double-Cmd-C leverages existing KnowledgeFactory infrastructure:**

1. **Hammerspoon** (macOS automation)
   - Monitors keyboard events for double Cmd+C
   - Reads clipboard content
   - Triggers Claude Code command

2. **Claude Code** (AI processing)
   - Receives clipboard content via Hammerspoon
   - Runs `/capture` or `/youtube-note` or `/idea` based on content type
   - Uses existing MCP servers (YouTube, GitHub, Firecrawl, Obsidian)

3. **obsidian-vault-manager-plugin** (templates & automation)
   - Content type detection logic (already exists)
   - AI tagging with taxonomy (already exists)
   - Template routing (already exists)
   - `/publish` command (already exists)

4. **Sharehub** (publishing platform)
   - Two-repo architecture (vault → sharehub)
   - Image handling (copy + path conversion)
   - GitHub Pages deployment
   - Password protection support

**Double-Cmd-C adds:**
- ✅ Global keyboard shortcut (Double-Cmd-C for capture)
- ✅ Background processing (no terminal required)
- ✅ Visual notifications (capture success/failure)
- ✅ Publish hotkey (Cmd+Shift+P or similar)
- ✅ Error handling (offline mode, rate limiting)

### Real-World Example: From Fragmented Idea to Published Knowledge

**Scenario**: You see a valuable tweet thread about AI architecture

**Without Double-Cmd-C (9 steps, 5+ minutes):**
1. Copy tweet URL
2. Switch to terminal
3. Run `claude`
4. Run `/capture <paste-url>`
5. Wait for processing
6. Switch to Obsidian to verify
7. Manually export to blog/Medium
8. Format for publishing
9. Share URL

**With Double-Cmd-C (2 simple gestures, 68 seconds):**
1. Select tweet URL → **Double-Cmd-C** (0.5s)
   - *Notification: "✅ Captured! Article note created with tags: [AI, architecture, reference]"*
   - Continue browsing, no interruption
2. Note appears in vault (3s AI processing in background)
   - Fully formatted, tagged, organized
3. (Optional) Review and refine note in Obsidian
4. **Cmd+Shift+P** to publish (5s + 60s deploy)
   - *Notification: "🚀 Publishing AI architecture thread..."*
   - *Final: "✅ Published! https://yourname.github.io/sharehub/documents/ai-architecture-thread.html"*
   - URL copied to clipboard automatically

**Result**: From fragmented tweet → refined published knowledge in 68 seconds
**Your effort**: 2 simple hotkeys (Double-Cmd-C + Cmd+Shift+P)
**KnowledgeFactory's work**: Detection, extraction, formatting, tagging, linking, publishing

## 📝 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Capture Automation (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Replace manual `/capture` with double Cmd+C hotkey

**Components:**
1. **Hammerspoon capture script** (`doublecmdc-capture.lua`)
   ```lua
   -- Monitor for double Cmd+C keyboard event
   -- Read clipboard content
   -- Detect content type (URL patterns, plain text)
   -- Trigger Claude Code command via CLI
   ```

2. **Claude Code integration**
   - Receives clipboard content as argument
   - Routes to `/capture`, `/youtube-note`, `/gitingest`, or `/idea`
   - Uses existing MCP servers and templates

3. **Visual feedback**
   - macOS notification: "✅ Captured! [content-type] note created"
   - Show generated filename and tags
   - Error notifications with user-friendly messages

**Testing:**
- YouTube URL → `/youtube-note`
- GitHub URL → `/gitingest`
- Web article URL → `/capture`
- Plain text → `/idea`
- Empty clipboard → Error notification

---

### Phase 2: Publishing Automation (Week 3-4)

**Goal**: Replace manual `/publish` command with Cmd+Shift+P hotkey

**Components:**
1. **Hammerspoon publish script** (`doublecmdc-publish.lua`)
   ```lua
   -- Detect active Obsidian note
   -- Get note filename
   -- Trigger /publish command via Claude Code CLI
   ```

2. **Publishing workflow**
   - Read current note path from Obsidian
   - Run `/publish <note-filename>.md`
   - Track git push status
   - Wait for GitHub Pages deployment (~60s)

3. **Visual feedback**
   - Notification: "🚀 Publishing [note-title]..."
   - Progress indicator during GitHub Pages deploy
   - Final notification: "✅ Published! [shareable-url]"
   - Copy URL to clipboard automatically

**Testing:**
- Public note (`access: public`) → Published without password
- Private note (`access: private`) → Published with password protection
- Note with images → Images copied + paths converted
- Invalid frontmatter → Error with helpful message

---

### Phase 3: Background Processing (Week 5-6)

**Goal**: Run capture/publish without requiring terminal or Claude Code to be open

**Components:**
1. **Background daemon** (`doublecmdc-daemon`)
   - Runs Claude Code in background
   - Listens for Hammerspoon triggers
   - Processes capture/publish queue
   - Manages MCP server connections

2. **Queue system**
   - Offline mode: Queue captures when vault unavailable
   - Rate limiting: Prevent accidental rapid captures (max 1/sec)
   - Retry logic: Auto-retry failed operations
   - Error recovery: Graceful degradation

3. **System integration**
   - Launch daemon on macOS login (launchd)
   - Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory)
   - Automatic restart on crashes
   - Clean shutdown on system sleep

**Testing:**
- Capture while offline → Queued and processed when online
- Multiple rapid captures → Rate limited to 1/sec
- Daemon crash → Automatic restart
- System sleep/wake → Queue preserved

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)

**Goal**: Polish user experience and add power-user features

**Features:**
1. **Smart content detection**
   - Image clipboard → OCR + create image note
   - Code snippet → Detect language + create code note
   - PDF link → Extract text + create document note
   - Multiple URLs → Batch capture

2. **Customization**
   - Configurable hotkeys (not just double Cmd+C)
   - Custom templates for different content types
   - Tag preferences (which tags to auto-apply)
   - Notification preferences (verbose, minimal, silent)

3. **Advanced publishing**
   - Bulk publish: Select multiple notes + Cmd+Shift+P
   - Scheduled publishing: Set publish date/time
   - Draft mode: Publish to staging branch first
   - Unpublish: Remove from sharehub with one command

4. **Analytics & insights**
   - Capture statistics (daily/weekly counts)
   - Most-captured content types
   - Publishing frequency
   - Sharehub traffic (if enabled)

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Distribution (Week 9-10)

**Goal**: Make doublecmdc easy to install and use for others

**Deliverables:**
1. **Installation wizard**
   - One-command setup: `bash <(curl -s https://...)`
   - Detects Hammerspoon, Claude Code, Obsidian
   - Auto-configures settings
   - Validates MCP server connections

2. **Documentation**

## 💎 The Value Proposition

### What Makes Double-Cmd-C Revolutionary

**It's not a clipboard manager. It's the simplest interface to an AI-powered knowledge engine.**

**The Promise:**
> "You provide raw, fragmented input. KnowledgeFactory transforms it into refined, organized, shareable knowledge—automatically."

**The simplicity:**
- **Your action**: Double-Cmd-C (one gesture, 0.5 seconds)
- **KnowledgeFactory's work**: Detection, extraction, formatting, tagging, organizing, connecting, making shareable
- **Your result**: Permanent knowledge asset, instantly findable, immediately shareable

### The Three Impossibilities It Makes Possible

**1. Capture Without Interruption**
- **Before**: Capturing means stopping what you're doing
- **After**: Double Cmd+C, keep working, note appears in vault

**2. Organization Without Effort**
- **Before**: Manual tagging is exhausting at scale
- **After**: AI tags everything perfectly in 3 seconds

**3. Sharing Without Friction**
- **Before**: Exporting to blog/Medium takes 5+ minutes
- **After**: Cmd+Shift+P, URL ready in 68 seconds

### The Compounding Effect

**Week 1 with doublecmdc:**
- 50 captures (vs. 5 manual captures)
- 10 published notes (vs. 0 manual exports)
- Knowledge shared: 10x increase

**Month 1 with doublecmdc:**
- 200+ captures (vs. 20 manual captures)
- 40+ published notes (vs. 2 manual exports)
- Knowledge shared: 20x increase
- Network effects: Your published knowledge gets discovered, shared, linked

**Year 1 with doublecmdc:**
- 2,400+ captures (vs. 240 manual captures)
- 480+ published notes (vs. 24 manual exports)
- Knowledge shared: Your entire vault becomes a searchable, shareable knowledge base
- Impact: Your ideas reach thousands instead of sitting unused in notes

### Why This Matters for KnowledgeFactory

**Double-Cmd-C transforms KnowledgeFactory from a "tool" into a "habit":**

**Without Double-Cmd-C:**
- KnowledgeFactory is powerful but requires conscious effort
- You have to "remember" to open terminal, run commands
- Friction prevents habit formation
- Knowledge stays fragmented in your head

**With Double-Cmd-C:**
- Capturing becomes unconscious (like copying text)
- No decisions required (KnowledgeFactory handles everything)
- Publishing becomes effortless (one hotkey)
- Habits form naturally because there's ZERO friction

**Result**: KnowledgeFactory becomes your automatic knowledge workflow, not a special tool you "decide" to use.

## 🚀 Vision: The Ultimate Knowledge Workflow

**Imagine your workday with doublecmdc:**

**Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM):**
- Reading articles, seeing tweets, watching YouTube
- Every valuable insight: Double Cmd+C
- 15 captures in 3 hours (0 context switches)

**Lunch break:**
- Open Obsidian, review morning captures
- AI already tagged and organized everything
- Refine 2-3 notes with insights
- Cmd+Shift+P to publish the best one

**Afternoon (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM):**
- More captures (research, GitHub repos, code examples)
- Another 10 captures (still 0 context switches)

**End of day:**
- 25 captures total (vs. 2-3 manual captures)
- 3 published notes (vs. 0 manual exports)
- Your knowledge vault grew 10x faster
- Your public knowledge base is live and shareable

**Result over time:**
- Private vault: Comprehensive knowledge archive (everything you learned)
- Public sharehub: Curated expertise (best insights shared with world)
- Zero organizational debt (AI handles all tagging/formatting)
- Maximum knowledge leverage (capture everything, share the best)

## 🏷️ Tags Analysis

**Content Analysis:**
- **Type**: `idea` (Captured thought/concept for a productivity tool)
- **Topics**: `productivity` (workflow optimization), `automation` (keyboard shortcuts, background processing), `knowledge-management` (Obsidian integration, capture workflow), `tools` (macOS utility)
- **Characteristics**: `actionable` (has concrete implementation steps), `technical` (requires Hammerspoon scripting, MCP integration, clipboard handling)
- **Priority**: `high` - This directly addresses the core friction point in knowledge capture workflows. Implementing this would significantly improve the KnowledgeFactory user experience and adoption.

**Why These Tags:**
- `productivity` + `automation` + `knowledge-management` + `tools` cover the four key aspects of this solution
- `actionable` because there are clear next steps for implementation
- `technical` because it requires scripting, API integration, and understanding of macOS automation
- `high` priority because reducing capture friction is a known high-leverage improvement

**Suggested Bases Filters:**
- Find similar ideas: `type = idea AND tags contains "productivity"`
- Find actionable items: `type = idea AND tags contains "actionable" AND status = inbox`
- Find by priority: `priority = high AND status = inbox`
- Find by topic combination: `tags contains "productivity" AND tags contains "automation"`
